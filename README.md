# Beginner-Projects
This is a collection of projects that come from primarily Python Mega Course on Udemy and Youtube Tutorials. This is just more so for my own personal expirmentation and growth. 
- Robot Arm Project is from Second Semester Senior Year of High School (i.e. it's not good). The program itself features multiple commands to move the arm and fingers in a specific pattern. 
- Interactive Web Maps - Uses Python Libraries Folium and Pandas to create a Map with pinpoints to all the various volcanoes in North America. Additionally, each Pinpoint features the elevation and a google search to the volcano.
