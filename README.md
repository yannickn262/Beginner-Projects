# Beginner-Projects
This is a collection of projects that come from primarily Python Mega Course on Udemy and Youtube Tutorials. This is just more so for my own personal expirmentation and growth. 
- Robot Arm Project is from Second Semester Senior Year of High School (i.e. it's not good). The program itself features multiple commands to move the arm and fingers in a specific pattern. I'm currently going back and making it more readable as well as better layed out with comments (etc.).
